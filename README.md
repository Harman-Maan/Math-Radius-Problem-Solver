# This is a Old Poject

I build this project when I was starting to learn code.
I edited the file a little, I deleted the repeated code, changed styles here and there, made the site responsive and added comments in JS. 
However, this document doesn't depict my current developing skills. I can do better, but I think this will do for now. I might do some updates in future.

You can use my code in anyway you want.

That's all, Boi-Boi.
